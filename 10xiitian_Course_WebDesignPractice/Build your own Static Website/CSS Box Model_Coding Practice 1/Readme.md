CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways: <br />
**Inline** - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements <br /> 
Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section  <br />
External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file <br />

The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files and I will be also following this.

CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style. 

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories: <br />
Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)  <br />
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)  <br />
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)  <br />
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element) <br />
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)  <br />

CSS Simple Selector includes Element Selector, Id Selector, Class Selector, Universal Selector, Group Selector.

In specific we will be using Class Selector in the above web design.

Class-Selector: The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.
To use class selector you must use ( . ) followed by class name in CSS. This rule will be applied to the 
HTML element with the class attribute “paragraph-class“  <br />

.paragraph-class {  <br />
    color:white;   <br />
    font-family: monospace;  <br />
    background-color: purple;  <br />
}   <br />
